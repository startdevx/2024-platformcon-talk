## Abstract description
Developer experience is a critical aspect to ensure that your software engineers can achieve the productivity they deserve. Eliminating cognitive load from processes and configurations, as well as reducing unnecessary boilerplate code, are crucial for enabling software engineers to focus on their work.

I will explain how the creation of an in-house CLI within our organization helped improve our software engineers' productivity. Key takeaways include:
* Understanding the problems we aimed to address
* Learning about the internal development and inner source implementation of our CLI
* Understanding how we measure the impact of our CLI usage
* Gaining insights about future enhancements we would like to implement
